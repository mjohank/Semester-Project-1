          You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why
          not travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our
          exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make
          sure you come ready to learn and explore.

          We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
          Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where youâ€™ll get to explore and
          experiment with our team of experts.

        <p class="feature-text">
          During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can
          join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each
          holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the
          holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.

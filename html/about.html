          Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
          understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
          from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.

          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
          experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
          lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

          We have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of
          science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to
          interact with and play around to see science come to life.
